## Solar System Model

This Python program models celestial bodies like the Sun, Planets, and Moons. It reads data from a JSON file, preprocesses it to standardize the information, and then creates instances of celestial bodies based on that data. The program calculates various properties, such as volume, circumference, and orbital details, and displays information about the Sun, its planets, and moons.
